# WeekFiveCTA

This program takes five numbers from the user using a scanner object. It
 * keeps checking to make sure the user is actually entering valid integers. If
 * the user types in an incorrect input, they will be asked to enter another
 * number. It will keep asking them to enter a valid input until a valid number
 * is given. Afterwards, all five numbers are entered and stored in an array,
 * and the program uses a recursive method to find the product of all the
 * numbers in the array. The final product will be printed as the output.
